# Description

  This is a proof of concept backend for a social network API. The database is a noSQL mongodb database that uses mongoose for querying. This API sets up the backend that allows for the creation of users, thoughts that users create, a network of friends, and the ability to react to thoughts in comment form. Currently the app has no front end and is under development.
